## Description
Dark Hole is a pioneering privacy tool designed as the first private ERC-20 token mixer on Zama. It utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to provide enhanced transaction anonymity for EVM-based assets. By implementing a randomized output system, darkHole ensures that each transaction output is unpredictable, significantly enhancing user privacy and memetic value.
